# F1 Telemetry Client for Rust

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This Rust library provides a telemetry client for the [F1® 23](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108330/F1_23/) game. It allows developers to access and interpret telemetry data generated by the [F1® 23](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108330/F1_23/) game during races. The library is designed to be modular, with distinct modules handling different aspects of the telemetry data.

## Usage Example

```rust
use f1_telemetry_client::F1TelemetryClient;

fn main() {
    let mut client: F1TelemetryClient = F1TelemetryClient::new("0.0.0.0:20777");
    client.set_car_telemetry_handler(Box::new(|packet: &f1_telemetry_client::packets::PacketCarTelemetryData| {
        println!("{:?}", packet);
    }));
    client.run();
}
```
